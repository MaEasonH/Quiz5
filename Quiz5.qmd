## Explaintion
To simulate the reading habits of five undergraduates—Matt, Ash, Jacki, Rol, and Mike—over 100 days, with each individual's daily page counts independent from the others, we use R to generate random data reflecting their unique reading patterns. By assigning each person a mean and standard deviation for their daily reading, we create a diverse set of reading behaviors, without any correlation, even between Ash and Jacki who were previously considered as a couple. This data is then visualized using ggplot2, producing a line graph that color-codes each undergraduate's reading journey across the days, clearly showcasing their individual reading habits in a straightforward, comparative manner. This approach provides a simple yet effective way to analyze and display the independent reading trends of each student over the specified period.

# Five Tests

## Descriptive Statistics Test
Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum number of pages read by each undergraduate. 

## One-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
To determine if there are statistically significant differences in the average number of pages read between the undergraduates

## Kruskal-Wallis Test
If the data do not meet the assumptions of normality required for ANOVA, the Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA, can be used.

## Pairwise Comparison Test
Following ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, if we find significant differences, pairwise comparison tests like Tukey's HSD (for ANOVA) or Dunn's test (for Kruskal-Wallis) 
can be conducted. 

## Time Series Analysis
Since the data is over a period of 100 days, conducting a time series analysis on the number of pages read daily by each undergraduate could reveal trends, cycles, or patterns in their reading habits over time.
